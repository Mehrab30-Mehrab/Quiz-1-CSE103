## Questions & Pseudo-code Solutions

### 1. **Math Formula Evaluation** üßÆ

**Problem:**  
Write a C program that takes an integer `n` as input and computes the following formula:  

```
result = (n^3 + 2n) / (n + 1) + sqrt(n)
```

**Expected Output:**  
Print the result with **two decimal places**.

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Input: Integer n
Calculate numerator = n^3 + 2 * n
Calculate denominator = n + 1
Calculate result = (numerator / denominator) + sqrt(n)
Print result with 2 decimal places
```

### 2. **Employee Salary Increment Based on Performance** üíº

**Problem:**  
Calculate and print the new salary of an employee based on their performance score.

- Score ‚â• 90 ‚Üí 20% increment  
- 80 ‚â§ Score < 90 ‚Üí 15% increment  
- 70 ‚â§ Score < 80 ‚Üí 10% increment  
- Score < 70 ‚Üí No increment

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Input: Current salary, Performance score
If score ‚â• 90:
    salary += 0.20 * salary
Else if score ‚â• 80:
    salary += 0.15 * salary
Else if score ‚â• 70:
    salary += 0.10 * salary
Else:
    salary remains same
Output: New salary
```

### 3. **Evaluate Output of Given C Expression** üß†

**Problem:**  
Given:
```c
int a = 12, b = 5;
float x = 3.5, y;
y = pow(a, b / 2) + (x * (b / 2)) - sqrt(a + b);
printf("%.2f", y);
```

**Concepts Tested:** Type casting, integer division, precedence, math functions

**Pseudo-code:**
```
a = 12, b = 5
x = 3.5
Evaluate y:
  = pow(12, 2) + (3.5 * 2) - sqrt(17)
  = 144 + 7 - 4.123
  ‚âà 146.88
Output: y rounded to 2 decimal places
```

### 4. **Find and Correct Errors in C Code** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:**  
Identify syntax and logic errors in the provided C snippet.

**Issues Found:**
- `Int` should be `int`
- Missing semicolon after `else`
- Incorrect use of `X` instead of `x`
- Incorrect casing and bracket structure

**Corrected Pseudo-code:**
```
Input: x, y, z
If x > y and x > z:
    print x is largest
Else if y > x and y > z:
    print y is largest
Else:
    print z is largest
```

### 5. **Convert Years, Months, and Days to Hours** ‚è∞

**Problem:**  
Given years, months, and days, convert the total time to hours.

**Assumptions:**  
- 1 year = 365 days  
- 1 month = 30 days  
- 1 day = 24 hours  

**Pseudo-code:**
```
Input: years, months, days
total_days = years * 365 + months * 30 + days
total_hours = total_days * 24
Output: total_hours
```
