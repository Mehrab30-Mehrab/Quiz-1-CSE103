### 🧮 Question 1: Mathematical Formula

✏️ Write a C program that computes the following formula:

\[
\text{result} = \frac{n^3 + 2n}{(n + 1) + \sqrt{n}}
\]

> 🔢 Print the result with **two decimal places**.

### 💼 Question 2: Salary Increment Program

👨‍💼 A company offers salary increments based on performance scores:

- 🔥 90 or above: 20% increment  
- 👍 80–89: 15% increment  
- 🙂 70–79: 10% increment  
- ❌ Below 70: No increment  

> 💻 Write a program that:
> - Takes **current salary** and **score**
> - Calculates the **new salary**

---

### 🤔 Question 3: Predict Output

📜 Given the code segment:

```c
int a = 12, b = 5;
float x = 3.5, y;
y = pow(a, b / 2) + (x * (b / 2)) - sqrt(a + b);
printf("%.2f", y);

```
🧠 What is the output? Show your calculation if needed!

###  🛠️ Question 4: Debug the Code
Find and correct the errors in the following C program:

```c
void Main()
{
    Int x, y, z;
    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &x, y, z);
    if(x > y & y > z)
        printf("Largest number is %d", X);
    else if(y > x & y > z)
        printf("Largest number is %d", y);
    Else
        printf("Largest number is %d", z);
}

```
🧑‍🔧 Spot the syntax and logic errors and fix them accordingly.

## 5️⃣ **Question 5: Time Conversion**  
⏱️ **Problem Statement:**  
Write a C program to convert years, months, and days into total hours using:
- 1 year = 365 days (ignoring leap years)
- 1 month = 30 days
- 1 day = 24 hours
